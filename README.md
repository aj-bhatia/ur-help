# URHelp

If you would like to run the project, please navigate to https://replit.com/@Crazychicken442/UrHelp-Final#pyproject.toml and run the project from there! This site will launch a complete web server with a database and everything else the program needs. If you would like to use the website once the webserver is deployed on Repl.it, you can use the webpage display on the top right of the page or click on the button to navigate to a new browser.
To run the webscraping script, use the repository: https://github.com/aj-bhatia/URhelpScraper.git. This can be run in a similar fashion to this replit page, and the script will continue running constantly!
